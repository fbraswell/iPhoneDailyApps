(Feb.4, 2004) – P-3 Orion patrol aircraft sit in storage at the Aerospace Maintenance And Regeneration Center (AMARC), located at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base (AFB) in Tucson, Ariz. Davis-Monthan AFB was selected as the site for the storage center due to Tucson’s meager rainfall, low humidity, and alkaline soil. These conditions make it possible to store aircraft indefinitely with a minimum of deterioration and corrosion. In addition, the soil (called caliche) is hard, making it possible to park aircraft in the desert without constructing concrete or steel parking ramps. AMARC is responsible for the storage and maintaining of aircraft for future redeployment, parts, or proper disposal following retirement by the military.
