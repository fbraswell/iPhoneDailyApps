<!--E11-18.3-->
<key>E11-18.3</key>
<string><![CDATA[When only your last battle remains to be fought, you shall find that the hand of your conquering Captain has not grown feeble – the living Saviour shall cheer the dying saint. E11-18
]]></string>

<!--M11-20.6-->
<key>M11-20.6</key>
<string><![CDATA[A grateful spirit should ever be cultivated by the Christian; and especially after deliverances we should prepare a song for our God. Earth should be a temple filled with the songs of grateful saints, and every day should be a censor smoking with the sweet incense of thanksgiving. M11-20
]]></string>

<!--M2-27.9-->
<key>M2-27.9</key>
<string><![CDATA[I am a pilgrim in the world, but at home in my God. In the earth I wander, but in God I dwell in a quiet habitation. M2-27
]]></string>

<!--E1-25.12-->
<key>E1-25.12</key>
<string><![CDATA["Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight." Grace is the mother and nurse of holiness, and not the apologist of sin. E1-25
]]></string>

<!--M1-25.15-->
<key>M1-25.15</key>
<string><![CDATA[Arise, go to the river of thine experience, and pull up a few bulrushes, and plait them into an ark, wherein thine infant–faith may float safely on the stream. M1-25
]]></string>

<!--E1-10.18-->
<key>E1-10.18</key>
<string><![CDATA[Mark the subject of Job's devout anticipation "I shall see God." He does not say, "I shall see the saints" – though doubtless that will be untold felicity – but, "I shall see God." It is not – "I shall see the pearly gates, I shall behold the walls of jasper, I shall gaze upon the crowns of gold," but "I shall see God." This is the sum and substance of heaven, this is the joyful hope of all believers. E1-10
]]></string>

<!--E1-11.21-->
<key>E1-11.21</key>
<string><![CDATA[We little know what we owe to our Saviour's prayers. When we reach the hill-tops of heaven, and look back upon all the way whereby the Lord our God hath led us, how we shall praise him who, before the eternal throne, undid the mischief which Satan was doing upon earth. E1-11
]]></string>

<!--E1-14.24-->
<key>E1-14.24</key>
<string><![CDATA[Sinking times are praying times with the Lord's servants. Peter neglected prayer at starting upon his venturous journey, but when he began to sink his danger made him a suppliant, and his cry though late was not too late. E1-14
]]></string>

<!--E1-14.27-->
<key>E1-14.27</key>
<string><![CDATA[In our hours of bodily pain and mental anguish, we find ourselves as naturally driven to prayer as the wreck is driven upon the shore by the waves. The fox hies [goes quickly] to its hole for protection; the bird flies to the wood for shelter; and even so the tried believer hastens to the mercy seat for safety. E1-14
]]></string>

<!--E1-14.30-->
<key>E1-14.30</key>
<string><![CDATA[A sense of need is a mighty teacher of brevity. If our prayers had less of the tail feathers of pride and more wing they would be all the better. E1-14 
]]></string>

<!--M1-15.36-->
<key>M1-15.36</key>
<string><![CDATA[Draw the word of promise out of its scabbard, and use it with holy violence. Think not that God will be troubled by your importunately reminding him of his promises. He loves to hear the loud outcries of needy souls. It is his delight to bestow favors. He is more ready to hear than you are to ask. The sun is not weary of shining, nor the fountain of flowing. It is God's nature to keep his promises; therefore go at once to the throne with "Do as thou hast said." M1-15
]]></string>

<!--E1-15.39-->
<key>E1-15.39</key>
<string><![CDATA[The common fault with the most of us is our readiness to yield to distractions. Our thoughts go roving hither and thither, and we make little progress towards our desired end. Like quicksilver our mind will not hold together, but rolls off this way and that. How great an evil this is! It injures us, and what is worse, it insults our God. What should we think of a petitioner, if, while having an audience with a prince, he should be playing with a feather or catching a fly? E1-15
]]></string>

<!--E1-16.42-->
<key>E1-16.42</key>
<string><![CDATA[Did the Lord Jesus stand as our representative? Are we healed by his stripes? It will be a terrible thing indeed if we should come short of a portion in his sacrifice; it were better for us that we had never been born. E1-16
]]></string>

<!--E1-17.45-->
<key>E1-17.45</key>
<string><![CDATA[They are well kept whom God keeps, but woe unto those who go forth into the world, or even dare to walk their own house unarmed. Those who think themselves secure are more exposed to danger than any others. The armour-bearer of Sin is Self-confidence. E1-17
]]></string>

<!--M1-19.48-->
<key>M1-19.48</key>
<string><![CDATA[Without Christ you are like a sheep without its shepherd; like a tree without water at its roots; like a sere [withered] leaf in the tempest – not bound to the tree of life. With thine whole heart seek him, and he will be found of thee: only give thyself thoroughly up to the search, and verily, thou shalt yet discover him to thy joy and gladness. M1-19
]]></string>

<!--M1-22.51-->
<key>M1-22.51</key>
<string><![CDATA[Whatever thou art, thou hast nothing to make thee proud. The more thou hast, the more thou art in debt to God; and thou shouldst not be proud of that which renders thee a debtor. M1-22
]]></string>

<!--M1-22.54-->
<key>M1-22.54</key>
<string><![CDATA[Therefore, be not proud, though thou hast a large estate – a wide domain of grace, thou hadst not once a single thing to call thine own except thy sin and misery. Oh! strange infatuation, that thou, who hast borrowed everything, shouldst think of exalting thyself; a poor dependent pensioner upon the bounty of thy Saviour, one who hath a life which dies without fresh streams of life from Jesus, and yet proud! Fie on thee, O silly heart! M1-22<br><br>[fie – An exclamation denoting contempt or dislike.]
]]></string>

<!--E1-22.57-->
<key>E1-22.57</key>
<string><![CDATA[As for the true Christian, he expects to have his reward in the next life, and to endure hardness in this. The promise of the old covenant was prosperity, but the promise of the new covenant is adversity. E1-22
]]></string>

<!--E1-22.60-->
<key>E1-22.60</key>
<string><![CDATA[Remember Christ's words – "Every branch in me that beareth not fruit" – What? "He purgeth it, that it may bring forth fruit." If you bring forth fruit, you will have to endure affliction. "Alas!" you say, "that is a terrible prospect." But this affliction works out such precious results, that the Christian who is the subject of it must learn to rejoice in tribulations, because as his tribulations abound, so his consolations abound by Christ Jesus. E1-22
]]></string>

<!--E1-22.63-->
<key>E1-22.63</key>
<string><![CDATA[Rest assured, if you are a child of God, you will be no stranger to the rod. Sooner or later every bar of gold must pass through the fire. Fear not, but rather rejoice that such fruitful times are in store for you, for in them you will be weaned from earth and made meet for heaven; you will be delivered from clinging to the present, and made to long for those eternal things which are so soon to be revealed to you. E1-22
]]></string>

<!--# 20-->

<!--M1-23.69-->
<key>M1-23.69</key>
<string><![CDATA[The believer can say, "I have a Brother in heaven; I may be poor, but I have a Brother who is rich, and is a King, and will he suffer me to want while he is on his throne? Oh, no! He loves me; he is my Brother." Believer, wear this blessed thought, like a necklace of diamonds, around the neck of thy memory; put it, as a golden ring, on the finger of recollection, and use it as the King's own seal, stamping the petitions of thy faith with confidence of success. M1-23
]]></string>

<!--M1-23.72-->
<key>M1-23.72</key>
<string><![CDATA[Christ was also chosen out of the people that he might know our wants and sympathize with us. "He was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin." In all our sorrows we have his sympathy. Temptation, pain, disappointment, weakness, weariness, poverty – he knows them all, for he has felt all. M1-23
]]></string>

<!--M1-23.75-->
<key>M1-23.75</key>
<string><![CDATA[Remember this, Christian, and let it comfort thee. However difficult and painful thy road, it is marked by the footsteps of thy Saviour; and even when thou reachest the dark valley of the shadow of death, and the deep waters of the swelling Jordan, thou wilt find his footprints there. In all places whithersoever we go, he has been our forerunner; each burden we have to carry, has once been laid on the shoulders of Immanuel. M1-23
]]></string>

<!--M1-24.78-->
<key>M1-24.78</key>
<string><![CDATA["His way was much rougher and darker than mine – Did Christ, my Lord, suffer, and shall I repine?"<br>Take courage! Royal feet have left a blood-red track upon the road, and consecrated the thorny path forever. M1-24
]]></string>

<!--M1-23.81-->
<key>M1-23.81</key>
<string><![CDATA["Surely he shall deliver thee out of the snare of the fowler." Thou shalt yet be brought out of all evil into which thou hast fallen, and though thou shalt never cease to repent of thy ways, yet he that hath loved thee will not cast thee away; he will receive thee, and give thee joy and gladness, that the bones which he has broken may rejoice. No bird of paradise shall die in the fowler's net. M1-23
]]></string>

<!--E1-24.84-->
<key>E1-24.84</key>
<string><![CDATA[Her [Martha's] fault was that she grew "cumbered with much serving," so that she forgot him, and only remembered the service. She allowed service to override communion, and so presented one duty stained with the blood of another. We ought to be Martha and Mary in one: we should do much service, and have much communion at the same time. For this we need great grace. It is easier to serve than to commune. E1-24
]]></string>

<!--E1-24.87-->
<key>E1-24.87</key>
<string><![CDATA[The more spiritual the exercise, the sooner we tire in it. The choicest fruits are the hardest to rear: the most heavenly graces are the most difficult to cultivate. Beloved, while we do not neglect external things, which are good enough in themselves, we ought also to see to it that we enjoy living, personal fellowship with Jesus. E1-24
]]></string>

<!--E1-24.90-->
<key>E1-24.90</key>
<string><![CDATA[The first thing for our soul's health, the first thing for his glory, and the first thing for our own usefulness, is to keep ourselves in perpetual communion with the Lord Jesus, and to see that the vital spirituality of our religion is maintained over and above everything else in the world. E1-24
]]></string>

<!--M1-26.93-->
<key>M1-26.93</key>
<string><![CDATA[Go back, then, a little way to the choice mercies of yesterday, and though all may be dark now, light up the lamps of the past, they shall glitter through the darkness, and thou shalt trust in the Lord till the day break and the shadows flee away. M1-26
]]></string>

<!--M1-25.96-->
<key>M1-25.96</key>
<string><![CDATA[Abba, Father! He who can say this, hath uttered better music than cherubim or seraphim can reach. There is heaven in the depth of that word – Father! There is all I can ask; all my necessities can demand; all my wishes can desire. I have all in all to all eternity when I can say, "Father." M1-25
]]></string>

<!--# 30-->

<!--E1-26.102-->
<key>E1-26.102</key>
<string><![CDATA[But to each believer redemption is most marvellous as he views it in relation to himself. It is a miracle of grace indeed, that Jesus should forsake the thrones and royalties above, to suffer ignominiously below for you. Let your soul lose itself in wonder, for wonder is in this way a very practical emotion. Holy wonder will lead you to grateful worship and heartfelt thanksgiving. E1-26
]]></string>

<!--E1-26.105-->
<key>E1-26.105</key>
<string><![CDATA[That God should consider his fallen creature, man, and instead of sweeping him away with the besom of destruction, should himself undertake to be man's Redeemer, and to pay his ransom price, is, indeed marvellous! E1-26<br><br>[besom – a broom made of twigs tied around a stick]
]]></string>

<!--E1-27.108-->
<key>E1-27.108</key>
<string><![CDATA[Oh, but where are the scales that can weigh the Lord Christ? "He taketh up the isles as a very little thing:" – who shall take him up? "He weigheth the mountains in scales" – in what scales shall we weigh him? Be it so, if your understanding cannot comprehend, let your affections apprehend; and if your spirit cannot compass the Lord Jesus in the grasp of understanding, let it embrace him in the arms of affection. E1-27
]]></string>

<!--E1-27.111-->
<key>E1-27.111</key>
<string><![CDATA["But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart." Luke 2:19<br><br> There was an exercise, on the part of this blessed woman, of three powers of her being: her memory – she kept all these things; her affections – she kept them in her heart; her intellect – she pondered them; so that memory, affection, and understanding, were all exercised about the things which she had heard. E1-27
]]></string>

<!--E1-27.114-->
<key>E1-27.114</key>
<string><![CDATA[Beloved, remember what you have heard of your Lord Jesus, and what he has done for you; make your heart the golden pot of manna to preserve the memorial of the heavenly bread whereon you have fed in days gone by. Let your memory treasure up everything about Christ which you have either felt, or known, or believed, and then let your fond affections hold him fast for evermore. Love the person of your Lord! Bring forth the alabaster box of your heart, even though it be broken, and let all the precious ointment of your affection come streaming on his pierced feet. E1-27
]]></string>

<!--M1-28.117-->
<key>M1-28.117</key>
<string><![CDATA[Oh, it is a marvellous salvation this! Christ takes a worm and transforms it into an angel; Christ takes a black and deformed thing and makes it clean and matchless in his glory, peerless in his beauty, and fit to be the companion of seraphs. O my soul, stand and admire this blessed truth of perfection in Christ. M1-28
]]></string>

<!--M1-28.120-->
<key>M1-28.120</key>
<string><![CDATA[Do you not feel in your own soul that perfection is not in you? Does not every day teach you that? Every tear which trickles from your eye, weeps "imperfection;" every harsh word which proceeds from your lip, mutters "imperfection." You have too frequently had a view of your own heart to dream for a moment of any perfection in yourself. But amidst this sad consciousness of imperfection, here is comfort for you – you are "perfect in Christ Jesus." M1-28
]]></string>

<!--E1-30.123-->
<key>E1-30.123</key>
<string><![CDATA[You have no right to heaven in yourself: your right lies in Christ. If you are pardoned, it is through his blood; if you are justified, it is through his righteousness; if you are sanctified, it is because he is made of God unto you sanctification; if you shall be kept from falling, it will be because you are preserved in Christ Jesus; and if you are perfected at the last, it will be because you are complete in him. E1-30
]]></string>

<!--E1-28.126-->
<key>E1-28.126</key>
<string><![CDATA[If you have seen Jesus with the God-giving sight of faith, suffer no cobwebs to linger among the harp strings, but loud to the praise of sovereign grace, awake your psaltery and harp. E1-28
]]></string>

<!--M1-29.129-->
<key>M1-29.129</key>
<string><![CDATA[The joys of heaven will surely compensate for the sorrows of earth. Hush, hush, my doubts! death is but a narrow stream, and thou shalt soon have forded it. Time, how short – eternity, how long! Death, how brief – immortality, how endless! Methinks I even now eat of Eshcol's clusters, and sip of the well which is within the gate. The road is so, so short! I shall soon be there. M1-29
]]></string>

<!--# 40-->

<!--M1-30.135-->
<key>M1-30.135</key>
<string><![CDATA["I can only spread the sail; – Thou! Thou! must breathe the auspicious gale."<br><br> Only be sure you have the sail up. Do not miss the gale for want of preparation for it. Seek help of God, that you may be more earnest in duty when made more strong in faith; that you may be more constant in prayer when you have more liberty at the throne; that you may be more holy in your conversation whilst you live more closely with Christ. M1-30
]]></string>

<!--E1-31.138-->
<key>E1-31.138</key>
<string><![CDATA[How is it with my spiritual journey, am I laboring up the hill of my own works and down into the ravines of my own humiliations and resolutions, or do I run by the plain way of "Believe and live"? How blessed is it to wait upon the Lord by faith! The soul runs without weariness, and walks without fainting, in the way of believing. E1-31
]]></string>

<!--M2-1.141-->
<key>M2-1.141</key>
<string><![CDATA[Believer, do you recollect the day when your fetters fell off? Do you remember the place when Jesus met you, and said, "I have loved thee with an everlasting love; I have blotted out as a cloud thy transgressions, and as a thick cloud thy sins; they shall not be mentioned against thee any more forever." Oh! what a sweet season is that when Jesus takes away the pain of sin. M2-1
]]></string>

<!--E2-1.144-->
<key>E2-1.144</key>
<string><![CDATA[Thy love restrained me from committing the sin which is unto death, and withheld me from self-destruction. Thy love held back the axe when Justice said, "Cut it down! why cumbereth it the ground?" Thy love drew me into the wilderness, stripped me there, and made me feel the guilt of my sin, and the burden of mine iniquity. Thy love spake thus comfortably to me when, I was sore dismayed – "Come unto me, and I will give thee rest." E2-1
]]></string>

<!--E2-1.147-->
<key>E2-1.147</key>
<string><![CDATA[Oh, how matchless thy love when, in a moment, thou didst wash my sins away, and make my polluted soul, which was crimson with the blood of my nativity, and black with the grime of my transgressions, to be white as the driven snow, and pure as the finest wool. How thou didst commend thy love when thou didst whisper in my ears, "I am thine and thou art mine." E2-1
]]></string>

<!--M2-2.150-->
<key>M2-2.150</key>
<string><![CDATA["Without the shedding of blood is no remission." Hebrews 9:22<br><br>Persons of merely formal religion cannot understand how we can rejoice that all our sins are forgiven us for Christ's sake. Their works, and prayers, and ceremonies, give them very poor comfort; and well may they be uneasy, for they are neglecting the one great salvation, and endeavouring to get remission without blood. M2-2
]]></string>

<!--M2-2.153-->
<key>M2-2.153</key>
<string><![CDATA[My soul, sit down, and behold the justice of God as bound to punish sin; see that punishment all executed upon thy Lord Jesus, and fall down in humble joy, and kiss the dear feet of him whose blood has made atonement for thee. M2-2
]]></string>

<!--E2-2.156-->
<key>E2-2.156</key>
<string><![CDATA[Here is a theme for daily contemplation. The eternal purpose to redeem us from our foreseen ruin, to cleanse and sanctify us, and at last to glorify us, was of infinite antiquity, and runs side by side with immutable love and absolute sovereignty. E2-2
]]></string>

<!--E2-2.159-->
<key>E2-2.159</key>
<string><![CDATA[The covenant is always described as being everlasting, and Jesus, the second party in it, had his goings forth of old; he struck hands in sacred suretyship long ere the first of the stars began to shine, and it was in him that the elect were ordained unto eternal life. E2-2
]]></string>

<!--M2-4.162-->
<key>M2-4.162</key>
<string><![CDATA[Doth not a flight through illimitable plains of the ether of love inflame thy heart and compel thee to delight thyself in the Lord thy God? Surely as we meditate on "the love of the Lord," our hearts burn within us, and we long to love him more. M2-4
]]></string>

<!--# 50-->

<!--M2-3.168-->
<key>M2-3.168</key>
<string><![CDATA[What a debtor thou art to divine sovereignty! How much thou owest to his disinterested love, for he gave his own Son that he might die for thee. Consider how much you owe to his forgiving grace, that after ten thousand affronts he loves you as infinitely as ever. Consider what you owe to his power; how he has raised you from your death in sin; how he has preserved your spiritual life; how he has kept you from falling; and how, though a thousand enemies have beset your path, you have been able to hold on your way. M2-3
]]></string>

<!--M2-3.171-->
<key>M2-3.171</key>
<string><![CDATA[Consider what you owe to his immutability. Though you have changed a thousand times, he has not changed once. Thou art as deep in debt as thou canst be to every attribute of God. To God thou owest thyself, and all thou hast – yield thyself as a living sacrifice, it is but thy reasonable service. M2-3
]]></string>

<!--M2-6.174-->
<key>M2-6.174</key>
<string><![CDATA[All the bread your soul has eaten has come down from heaven, and all the water of which it has drank has flowed from the living rock – Christ Jesus the Lord. Your soul has never grown rich in itself; it has always been a pensioner upon the daily bounty of God; and hence your prayers have ascended to heaven for a range of spiritual mercies all but infinite. M2-6
]]></string>

<!--E2-6.177-->
<key>E2-6.177</key>
<string><![CDATA[As an encouragement cheerfully to offer intercessory prayer, remember that such prayer is the sweetest God ever hears, for the prayer of Christ is of this character. In all the incense which our Great High Priest now puts into the golden censer, there is not a single grain for himself. E2-6
]]></string>

<!--E2-6.180-->
<key>E2-6.180</key>
<string><![CDATA[When thou hast the King's ear, speak to him for the suffering members of his body. When thou art favored to draw very near to his throne, and the King saith to thee, "Ask, and I will give thee what thou wilt," let thy petitions be, not for thyself alone, but for the many who need his aid. E2-6
]]></string>

<!--M2-7.183-->
<key>M2-7.183</key>
<string><![CDATA[We know that there is a black and stormy river called "Death." God bids us cross it, promising to be with us. And, after death, what cometh? What wonder-world will open upon our astonished sight? What scene of glory will be unfolded to our view? No traveller has ever returned to tell. But we know enough of the heavenly land to make us welcome our summons thither with joy and gladness. M2-7
]]></string>

<!--M2-7.186-->
<key>M2-7.186</key>
<string><![CDATA[The journey of death may be dark, but we may go forth on it fearlessly, knowing that God is with us as we walk through the gloomy valley, and therefore we need fear no evil. We shall be departing from all we have known and loved here, but we shall be going to our Father's house – to our Father's home, where Jesus is – to that royal "city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God." M2-7
]]></string>

<!--M2-7.189-->
<key>M2-7.189</key>
<string><![CDATA[Christian, meditate much on heaven, it will help thee to press on, and to forget the toil of the way. This vale of tears is but the pathway to the better country: this world of woe is but the stepping-stone to a world of bliss. M2-7
]]></string>

<!--E2-7.192-->
<key>E2-7.192</key>
<string><![CDATA[Instead of dreading the time when we shall leave this world to go unto the Father, we should be panting for the hour of our emancipation. Our song should be:<br><br>"My heart is with him on his throne, – And ill can brook delay; – Each moment listening for the voice, – 'Rise up and come away.'" E2-7
]]></string>

<!--E2-7.195-->
<key>E2-7.195</key>
<string><![CDATA[We are not called down to the grave, but up to the skies. Our heaven-born spirits should long for their native air. Yet should the celestial summons be the object of patient waiting. Our God knows best when to bid us "Come up hither." E2-7

<string><![CDATA[Whether he be called the Husband of the Church, her Bridegroom, her Friend; whether he be styled the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world – the King, the Prophet, or the Priest – every title of our Master – Shiloh, Emmanuel, Wonderful, the Mighty Counsellor – every name is like the honeycomb dropping with honey, and luscious are the drops that distil from it. M2-8

<!--M2-8.204-->
<key>M2-8.204</key>
<string><![CDATA[Jesus! it is the name which moves the harps of heaven to melody. Jesus! the life of all our joys. If there be one name more charming, more precious than another, it is this name. It is woven into the very warp and woof of our psalmody. Many of our hymns begin with it, and scarcely any, that are good for anything, end without it. It is the sum total of all delights. It is the music with which the bells of heaven ring; a song in a word; an ocean for comprehension, although a drop for brevity; a matchless oratorio in two syllables; a gathering up of the hallelujahs of eternity in five letters. M2-8
]]></string>

<!--E2-8.207-->
<key>E2-8.207</key>
<string><![CDATA[No man is a true Christian if sin reigns in his mortal body. Sin will be in us – it will never be utterly expelled till the spirit enters glory; but it will never have dominion. There will be a striving for dominion – a lusting against the new law and the new spirit which God has implanted – but sin will never get the upper hand so as to be absolute monarch of our nature. E2-8
]]></string>

<!--E2-8.210-->
<key>E2-8.210</key>
<string><![CDATA[If your life is unholy your heart is unchanged, and if your heart is unchanged you are an unsaved person. If the Saviour has not sanctified you, renewed you, given you a hatred of sin and a love of holiness, he has done nothing in you of a saving character. The grace which does not make a man better than others is a worthless counterfeit. Christ saves his people, not in their sins, but from them. E2-8
]]></string>

<!--M2-9.213-->
<key>M2-9.213</key>
<string><![CDATA[Christian, if thou wouldst know the path of duty, take God for thy compass; if thou wouldst steer thy ship through the dark billows, put the tiller into the hand of the Almighty. Many a rock might be escaped, if we would let our Father take the helm; many a shoal or quicksand we might well avoid, if we would leave to his sovereign will to choose and to command. M2-9

<string><![CDATA[There is a lighthouse out at sea: it is a calm night – I cannot tell whether the edifice is firm; the tempest must rage about it, and then I shall know whether it will stand. So with the Spirit's work: if it were not on many occasions surrounded with tempestuous waters, we should not know that it was true and strong; if the winds did not blow upon it, we should not know how firm and secure it was.

<string><![CDATA[If then, yours be a much-tried path, rejoice in it, because you will the better show forth the all-sufficient grace of God. As for his failing you, never dream of it – hate the thought. The God who has been sufficient until now, should be trusted to the end. M3-4

<string><![CDATA[Think how much grace one saint requires, so much that nothing but the Infinite could supply him for one day; and yet the Lord spreads his table, not for one, but many saints, not for one day, but for many years; not for many years only, but for generation after generation. E3-4

<string><![CDATA[I once thought if I might but get the broken meat at God's back door of grace I should be satisfied; like the woman who said, "The dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the master's table;" but no child of God is ever served with scraps and leavings; like Mephibosheth [2 Samuel 9:11], they all eat from the king's own table.

<string><![CDATA[To be "born again," is a matter so mysterious, that human words cannot describe it. "The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit." Nevertheless, it is a change which is known and felt: known by works of holiness, and felt by a gracious experience. M3-6

<string><![CDATA[It is not an operation [being born again] which a man performs for himself: a new principle is infused, which works in the heart, renews the soul, and affects the entire man. It is not a change of my name, but a renewal of my nature, so that I am not the man I used to be, but a new man in Christ Jesus. To wash and dress a corpse is a far different thing from making it alive: man can do the one, God alone can do the other. M3-6

<string><![CDATA[If we forget to live at the foot of the cross in deepest lowliness of spirit, God will not forget to make us smart under his rod. A destruction will come to thee, O unduly exalted believer, the destruction of thy joys and of thy comforts, though there can be no destruction of thy soul. Wherefore, "He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord." E3-6

<string><![CDATA[Faith is the foot of the soul by which it can march along the road of the commandments. Love can make the feet move more swiftly; but faith is the foot which carries the soul. Faith is the oil enabling the wheels of holy devotion and of earnest piety to move well; and without faith the wheels are taken from the chariot, and we drag heavily. M3-7

If you love darkness, and are satisfied to dwell in gloom and misery, then be content with little faith; but if you love the sunshine, and would sing songs of rejoicing, covet earnestly this best gift, "great faith."

<string><![CDATA[Although tribulation is thus the path of God's children, they have the comfort of knowing that their Master has traversed it before them; they have his presence and sympathy to cheer them, his grace to support them, and his example to teach them how to endure; and when they reach "the kingdom," it will more than make amends for the "much tribulation" through which they passed to enter it.

<string><![CDATA[The stormy sea feeds multitudes with its fishes; the wild wood blooms with beauteous flowerets; the stormy wind sweeps away the pestilence, and the biting frost loosens the soil.

<string><![CDATA[Faith's way of walking is to cast all care upon the Lord, and then to anticipate good results from the worst calamities. Like Gideon's men, she does not fret over the broken pitcher, but rejoices that the lamp blazes forth the more. Out of the rough oyster-shell of difficulty she extracts the rare pearl of honor, and from the deep ocean-caves of distress she uplifts the priceless coral of experience. E3-8

<string><![CDATA[Beware of the smooth places of the way; if you are treading them, or if the way be rough, thank God for it. If God should always rock us in the cradle of prosperity; if we were always dandled on the knees of fortune; if we had not some stain on the alabaster pillar; if there were not a few clouds in the sky; if we had not some bitter drops in the wine of this life, we should become intoxicated with pleasure, we should dream "we stand;" and stand we should, but it would be upon a pinnacle; like the man asleep upon the [ship's] mast, each moment we should be in jeopardy.

Beloved reader, set not your affections upon things of earth: but seek those things which are above, for here the moth devoureth, and the thief breaketh through, but there all joys are perpetual and eternal. The path of trouble is the way home. Lord, make this thought a pillow for many a weary head! E3-10

Look upon all sin as that which crucified the Saviour, and you will see it to be "exceeding sinful." M3-11
