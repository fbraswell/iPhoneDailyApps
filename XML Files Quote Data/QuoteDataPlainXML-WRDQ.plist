England, France, Belgium and Italy were near the President, and the nations that didn’t owe us a cent were at the foot of the table.

It’s a $16,000,000 corporation. Each gang gets preferred stock in proportion to the notches on their present machine guns. They figure it will reduce their present overhead which consists mostly now of flowers and caskets.

I guess there has never been a time in our history when as many fools are making money as now, Just to be rich and nothing else, is practically a disgrace nowadays.

<string><![CDATA[Have you been reading about the disgraceful way the Senate has been carrying on lately? You know our old Forefathers that laid out the time that our Congress was to meet knew something— they always held Congress in cool weather. They knew a Senator couldn’t stand up under the heat and his position, too. When hot weather hits him not only his body but his brain perspires and the discharge from both is equally useless.

<string><![CDATA[They [Congress] are all arguing over what to do with it [a surplus], but nobody has ever suggested applying it on our national debt, which is over $30,000,000,000. Sixty per cent of all our taxes go toward interest on all our various debts, national, State, town and county. But they will take this little dab and try to buy some party votes with it in the way of lower taxes. You wouldn’t see Mellon [Treasury Secretary] doing that if it applied to his personal affairs. He would get his debt paid off before he started handing anybody anything, but that’s just why so many of our individuals are so much richer than our government.

He is going to have to appoint a commission to keep track of the commissions that he has appointed. It just looks like there won’t be enough people in the country to go on all these commissions; I know there won’t be enough good ones.

It would not only spoil his golf, but his reputation. In fact, it would take away his amateur standing, for as an amateur everything is done with no thought of any possible gain.

But—there is always a “but” to all good news—they are going to meet again. So we can’t hope for this continued prosperity.

It was suggested to the Northern boys at their reunion the other day that they hold a joint reunion with the Southern. Well, they just pulled out their whiskers and started firing ’em at the suggester. Said they would never meet ’em till the South admitted they was wrong. So that is one merger that is off indefinitely.

Why, an old sow and a litter of pigs make more people a living than all the steel and general motor stock combined. Why, the whole 120,000,000 of us are more dependent on the cackling of a hen than if the stock exchange was turned into a night club. And New Yorkers call them rubes [unsophisticated country person].
