</p></p>

<p>The image below shows the touch-sensitive areas of the screen used for navigating the quotes application. The areas are transparent to the image and quote displays.</p>

<p>When the application is launched the quote for the day is displayed on the screen. Navigating through the other quotes in the collection is very simple, and is described below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="screen-layout.png" height="410" align="middle"></p>

<p><b>Center-left area.</b> Touching the center left area will return a quotation from a day before the day displayed. When the application is launched, the current day's quote is diaplayed. Touching this area will yield yesterday's quote. Touching it again will yield the day-before-yesterday's quote, and so on. You can go backwards as far as you want.</p>

<p><b>Center-right area.</b> Touching the center right area will return a quotation from the day after the day displayed. If today's quote is displayed, touching this area will yield tomorrow's quote. Touching it again will yield the day-after-tomorrow's quote, and son on. You can go forward as far as you want.</p>

<p><b>Upper screen area.</b> Touching the upper part of the screen will cause a random quote to be displayed. Touching it again will display another random quote.</p>

<p><b>Lower screen area.</b> The lower part of the screen is used to display the text of the quote. If the quote is longer than the box on the screen it can be scrolled using an up or down swipe gesture within the text area.</p>

<p><b>Info button.</b> Touching the info button in the lower right part of the screen will display various help and information options. Returning to the quote screen from the options is done by touching the navigation button in the upper left part of the screen.</p>

<p><b>Navigating the quotes.</b> As mentioned earlier the quotes can be navigated forward and backward one day at a time in sequence as far as desired. If a random quote is chosen however, the daily sequence is broken. If the forward or backward button is touched, the day before or after the  random quote, relative to the new position is displayed. </p>

<p><b>Taps during transition.</b> During transitions, taps are ignored.</p>
